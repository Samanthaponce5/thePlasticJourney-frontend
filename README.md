## Jack's Journey

An educational project aiming to teach everyone more about plastic pollution, the effects it has on marine life, and how they can help to reduce the issue. Inspired by my love for nature and my favorite animal the sea turtle. You can navigate the ocean as a sea turtle named Jack( name inspired after my turtle)
